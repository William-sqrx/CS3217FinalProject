# AliceInBoredomLand

summary:
- One lane plant versus zombie. There are heroes and monsters. Each character is a card to minimize UI. Tower on left and right side.

Note:
- Keep it Simple Stupid 

todo: 
- models should have more specific characteristics
- simulate a round where mosnters and heroes exchange attack (until one castle is destroyed)
- import simple graphics
- implement tile based movements
- testing
